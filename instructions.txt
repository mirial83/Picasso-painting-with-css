Step 1
Start by setting up your HTML structure. 
Add a <!DOCTYPE> declaration and an html 
element with a lang attribute set to en. 
Within the html element, add a head element 
and a body element.

Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta 
tag with the charset attribute set to 
utf-8. Also add a title element with 
the text Picasso Painting.
