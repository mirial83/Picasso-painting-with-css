Step 1
Start by setting up your HTML structure. 
Add a <!DOCTYPE> declaration and an html 
element with a lang attribute set to en. 
Within the html element, add a head element 
and a body element.

Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta 
tag with the charset attribute set to 
utf-8. Also add a title element with 
the text Picasso Painting.

Step 3
Go ahead and link your CSS file now, even 
though you have not written any CSS yet.

Add a link element with a rel of stylesheet 
and an href of styles.css.

Step 4
FontAwesome is a library of SVG-powered 
icons, many of which are freely available 
to use. You will be using some of these 
icons in this project, so you will need 
to link the external stylesheet to your 
HTML.

Add a link element with a rel of 
stylesheet and an href of 
https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css.

Step 5
To get your painting started, give your 
body element a background-color of rgb(184, 132, 46).

Step 6
Within your body tag, add a div element. 
Give it an id of back-wall.

Step 7
Use an id selector to give the element with the 
id back-wall a background-color of #8B4513.

Step 8
Give the #back-wall element a width of 100% 
and a height of 60%.

Step 9
Typically, HTML is rendered in a top-down manner. 
Elements at the top of the code are positioned at 
the top of the page. However, many times you may 
want to move the elements to different positions. 
You can do this with the position property.

Set the position property for the #back-wall element 
to absolute. An absolute position takes the element 
out of that top-down document flow and allows you to 
adjust it relative to its container.

When an element is manually positioned, you can shift 
its layout with top, left, right, and bottom. Set the 
#back-wall element to have a top value of 0, and a 
left value of 0.â‰¥lo09
