Step 1
Start by setting up your HTML structure. 
Add a <!DOCTYPE> declaration and an html 
element with a lang attribute set to en. 
Within the html element, add a head element 
and a body element.

Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta 
tag with the charset attribute set to 
utf-8. Also add a title element with 
the text Picasso Painting.

Step 3
Go ahead and link your CSS file now, even 
though you have not written any CSS yet.

Add a link element with a rel of stylesheet 
and an href of styles.css.
